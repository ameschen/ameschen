### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amy!

I am currently in the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) program at the University of British Columbia. Before this, I studied Biology and worked in clinical research, industrial labs, as well as a couple other side jobs (including 3 years as a part-time barista)! 


### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 

- web development (including HTML, CSS and Javascript)
- the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

### âš¡ In my free time:

- I love hiking during the (two months of) Vancouver summer 
- You will likely find me at the gym
- I also love learning, and it doesn't stop with code - I am always baking and cooking something new!
